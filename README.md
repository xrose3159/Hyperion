# HYPERION: Fine-Grained Hypersphere Alignment for Robust Federated Graph Learning

## Abstract


Robust Federated Graph Learning (FGL) provides an effective decentralized framework for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in noisy-label environments. However, the subtlety of noise during training presents formidable obstacles for developing robust FGL systems. Previous robust FL approaches neither adequately constrain edge-mediated error propagation nor account for intra-class topological differences. At the client level, we innovatively demonstrate that hyperspherical embedding can effectively capture graph structures in a fine-grained manner. Correspondingly, our method effectively addresses the aforementioned issues through fine-grained hypersphere alignment. Moreover, we uncover undetected noise arising from localized perspective constraints and propose the geometric-aware hyperspherical purification module at the server level. Combining both level strategies, we present our robust FGL framework, **HYPERION**, which operates all components within a unified hyperspherical space. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments under cross-type and cross-ratio noise settings, showcasing the superiority of our framework across different datasets.
